Issue was the static library & shared library.

If the singleton class is part of the static plugin, it was not usable.
Once we made the plugin as shared library it started working fine.
May be issue with QML_IMPORT_PLUGIN in case of cmakelists.txt.
I have created two directories.
LogicModule -  This is shared library
MySingleTon & TestStaticLib were usable in Main.qml
StaticPlugin - This is static library
StaticPlugin class was not usable in Main.qml. Getting undefined reference.

Learnings

RESOURCE_PREFIX "/qt/qml/dheeru" will be staring directory.
URI will be as specified by the URI
target_link_libraries will help in linking the libraries.
add_subdirectory will start build the directory according to the
instructions in CMakeLists.txt file.
